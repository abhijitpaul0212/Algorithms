Find Median Given Frequency Of Numbers Problem

Description
LeetCode Problem 571.

The Numbers table keeps the value of number and its frequency.

+----------+-------------+
|  Number  |  Frequency  |
+----------+-------------|
|  0       |  7          |
|  1       |  1          |
|  2       |  3          |
|  3       |  1          |
+----------+-------------+
In this table, the numbers are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, so the median is (0 + 0) / 2 = 0.

+--------+
| median |
+--------|
| 0.0000 |
+--------+
Write a query to find the median of all numbers and name the result as median.

# The where clause ensures that weâ€™ll get the two middle values if there is an even number of values, and the single middle number if there is an odd number of values because between is inclusive of its bounds.
-- select avg(price) as median
-- from ordered_purchases
-- where row_id between ct/2.0 and ct/2.0 + 1
