"""
Given a collection of distinct integers, return all possible permutations.

Example:

Input: [1,2,3]
Output:
[
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3,2],
  [2,1,3],
  [2,3,1],
  [3,1,2],
  [3,2,1]
]


Solution:
1. Backtrackting
Here is a backtrack function which takes the index of the first integer to consider as an argument backtrack(first).

* If the first integer to consider has index n that means that the current permutation is done.
* Iterate over the integers from index first to index n - 1.
    * Place i-th integer first in the permutation, i.e. swap(nums[first], nums[i]).
    * Proceed to create all permutations which starts from i-th integer : backtrack(first + 1).
    * Now backtrack, i.e. swap(nums[first], nums[i]) back.
