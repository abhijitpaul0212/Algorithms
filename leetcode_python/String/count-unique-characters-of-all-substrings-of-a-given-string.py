828. Count Unique Characters of All Substrings of a Given String
Hard

Let's define a function countUniqueChars(s) that returns the number of unique characters on s.

For example, calling countUniqueChars(s) if s = "LEETCODE" then "L", "T", "C", "O", "D" are the unique characters since they appear only once in s, therefore countUniqueChars(s) = 5.
Given a string s, return the sum of countUniqueChars(t) where t is a substring of s.

Notice that some substrings can be repeated so in this case you have to count the repeated ones too.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ABC"
Output: 10
Explanation: All possible substrings are: "A","B","C","AB","BC" and "ABC".
Evey substring is composed with only unique letters.
Sum of lengths of all substring is 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10
Example 2:

Input: s = "ABA"
Output: 8
Explanation: The same as example 1, except countUniqueChars("ABA") = 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "LEETCODE"
Output: 92
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of uppercase English letters only.

# IDEA :
# Let's think about how a character can be found as a unique character.
# Think about string "XAXAXXAX" and focus on making the second "A" a unique character.
# We can take "XA(XAXX)AX" and between "()" is our substring.
# We can see here, to make the second "A" counted as a uniq character, we need to:
# insert "(" somewhere between the first and second A
# insert ")" somewhere between the second and third A
# For step 1 we have "A(XA" and "AX(A", 2 possibility.
# For step 2 we have "A)XXA", "AX)XA" and "AXX)A", 3 possibilities.
# So there are in total 2 * 3 = 6 ways to make the second A a unique character in a substring.
# In other words, there are only 6 substring, in which this A contribute 1 point as unique string.
# Instead of counting all unique characters and struggling with all possible substrings,
# we can count for every char in S, how many ways to be found as a unique char.
# We count and sum, and it will be out answer.
