41. First Missing Positive
Hard

Given an unsorted integer array nums, return the smallest missing positive integer.

You must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,0]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: nums = [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 105
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1

# Idea: change nums[n-1] to float('inf') for all n in nums if 1 <= n <= len(nums), meaning that we have seen n in nums. Then we traverse nums once more, and find the first idx such that nums[idx] != float('inf'), then idx+1 will be the first missing positive in nums. If no such idx exists, it means that we have seen 1, 2, ..., len(nums) in nums, hence the first missing positive is len(nums)+1.
