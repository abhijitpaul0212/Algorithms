1963. Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the String Balanced
Medium

You are given a 0-indexed string s of even length n. The string consists of exactly n / 2 opening brackets '[' and n / 2 closing brackets ']'.

A string is called balanced if and only if:

It is the empty string, or
It can be written as AB, where both A and B are balanced strings, or
It can be written as [C], where C is a balanced string.
You may swap the brackets at any two indices any number of times.

Return the minimum number of swaps to make s balanced.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "][]["
Output: 1
Explanation: You can make the string balanced by swapping index 0 with index 3.
The resulting string is "[[]]".
Example 2:

Input: s = "]]][[["
Output: 2
Explanation: You can do the following to make the string balanced:
- Swap index 0 with index 4. s = "[]][][".
- Swap index 1 with index 5. s = "[[][]]".
The resulting string is "[[][]]".
Example 3:

Input: s = "[]"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string is already balanced.
 

Constraints:

n == s.length
2 <= n <= 106
n is even.
s[i] is either '[' or ']'.
The number of opening brackets '[' equals n / 2, and the number of closing brackets ']' equals n / 2.

# IDEA :
# The idea is to traverse our string and check the biggest possible disbalance. For example if we look at ]]][]]][[[[[, for traversals we have:
# -1, -2, -3, -2, -3, -4, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0 and the biggest disbalance is equal to 5. What we can do in one swap of brackets is to decreas it at most by 2: for this we need to take the leftest ] with negative balance and the rightest [ with negative balance and change them. For example in our case we have:
#
# []][]]][[[[] : [1, 0, -1, 0, -1, -2, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 0]
#
# [][[]]][][[] : [1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -1, 0, -1, 0, 1, 0]
#
# [][[]][[]][] : [1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0]
#
# Complexity
# Time complexity is O(n) to traverse our string, space is O(1).
