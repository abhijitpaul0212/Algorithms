207. Course Schedule
Medium

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
 

Constraints:

1 <= numCourses <= 105
0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
prerequisites[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.

# IDEA :
# We first build a directed graph from prerequisites. The nodes are 0 to n-1, and there is an edge from i to j if i is the prerequisite of j. Then the courses can be finished if and only if the directed graph can be topologically sorted (equivalently, if and only if the directed graph is acyclic).
# We start by labelling each node 0, meaning that they have not been dfs visited. Then we iterate i in range(numCourses), and if i has not been dfs visited, we dfs visit i. If any of such dfs visits return False, we return False; Else we return True. For the dfs visit procedure, we first label i to be 1, meaning that we are currently dfs visiting the descendants of i in the dfs tree. Then for each neighbor j of i, If j has label 1, then j is a predecessor of i in the dfs visit, and i -> j is a back edge, so the graph contains a cycle, we return False; Else if j has label 0, it has not been visited, and we need to do dfs(j). If dfs(j) returns False, it means that the dfs subgraph starting with j contains a cycle, and we need to return False. Finally, if no dfs(j) returns False, it means that the dfs subgraph starting with i is acyclic, we label i to be 2, meaning that we finished dfs searches all the descendants of i, and we return True.
