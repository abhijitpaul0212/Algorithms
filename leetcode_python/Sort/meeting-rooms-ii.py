253. Meeting Rooms II
Medium

Given an array of meeting time intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of conference rooms required.

 

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= intervals.length <= 104
0 <= starti < endi <= 106
