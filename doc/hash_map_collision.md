# Birthday question
There are people keep walking into a room, at least how many people 
make the probability of ANY 2 PEOPLE HAS SAME BIRTHERDAY > 50 % ?

-> select 1 birthday
-> probability 2nd person's birthday different from 1st : 364/365
-> probability 3rd person's birthday different from 1st, 2nd : 363/365
.
.
-> probability krd person's birthday different from 1st, 2nd ...: (365-(k-1))/365

So, the probability of K people in the room BUT ALL WITH UNIQUE  birthday
-> (365/365)*(364/365)*....(365-(k-1))/365
-> above term is equal as (365)!/((365^n)*(365-n)!)

```
```
# Birthday question extension 
# given n people, every person select a value randomly from N differnt values (N is any larger than 0 interger). 
# p(n) means any 2 persons select THE SAME value, what's p(n)

-> p(n) ~= 1 - 1*(exp(n^2/2*N))^(-1) # which is as below
