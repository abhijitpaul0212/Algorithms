class Solution:
    def networkDelayTime(self, times, N, K):
        K -= 1

        for u, v, w in times:
            nodes[u - 1].append((v - 1, w))
        dist = [float('inf')] * N

                if v not in done and dist[smallest] + w < dist[v]:
                    dist[v] = dist[smallest] + w
            done.add(smallest)

### 2-2) Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
```python
# LC 787 Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
# V1
# IDEA : Dijkstra
# https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/discuss/267200/Python-Dijkstra
# IDEA
# -> To implement Dijkstra, we need a priority queue to pop out the lowest weight node for next search. In this case, the weight would be the accumulated flight cost. So my node takes a form of (cost, src, k). cost is the accumulated cost, src is the current node's location, k is stop times we left as we only have at most K stops. I also convert edges to an adjacent list based graph g.
# -> Use a vis array to maintain visited nodes to avoid loop. vis[x] record the remaining steps to reach x with the lowest cost. If vis[x] >= k, then no need to visit that case (start from x with k steps left) as a better solution has been visited before (more remaining step and lower cost as heappopped beforehand). And we should initialize vis[x] to 0 to ensure visit always stop at a negative k.
# -> Once k is used up (k == 0) or vis[x] >= k, we no longer push that node x to our queue. Once a popped cost is our destination, we get our lowest valid cost.
# -> For Dijkstra, there is not need to maintain a best cost for each node since it's kind of greedy search. It always chooses the lowest cost node for next search. So the previous searched node always has a lower cost and has no chance to be updated. The first time we pop our destination from our queue, we have found the lowest cost to our destination.
