I had originally posted as a comment here.

I thought I should open these questions to a broader set of audience as a separate article instead of a comment. Hence, this post.

Requesting guidance from those who solved 1000+ Leets so far.

What was your discipline/motivation/routine to spend so much time on LeetCode?
What is your daily work at your job like?
Do you see solution to the problems before solving it yourself?
How about hards? Did you solve them all by yourself? If not, how long do you try before giving up?
Do you regularly participate in any programming contests on other sites?
How long have you been coding algorithmic problems (not just on Lc)?
If not already working at Google or Facebook, would you like to work there? Have you interviewed with them before?
How did you manage to stick to grinding Lc when various other options were available like open source contributions, promotions at work, learning other tools and technologies?
How do you manage to balance time taking activities like family & friends, trips, parties, movies, netflix and chill, "oh god will i ever use this knowledge about data structures and algorithms in real life work"?
What would be your suggestions to the folks in community who are on or wish to travel on the same path?
Given infinite amount of time and asked to solve a problem without referring to other resources, I won't be able to solve some problems. How to deal with those questions in the interviews?
Any suggestions specific to solving DP problems? No matter how many problems one solves, its always less, especially with the bottom-up approach.
Those who have solved atleast 1000 questions, please feel free to answer all possible questions above.

I'll keep appending to the post some selective quesitons from the comments (with credits) which add more value to the community. So feel free to comment good questions.

Thanks in advance!
