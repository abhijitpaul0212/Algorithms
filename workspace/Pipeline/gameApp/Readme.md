# GameApp
- Online FPS game
- Raw event (json) from stream source
- Raw event sample as below:
```json
{"timetamp":1629857927,"user_id":"u0001","event_type":"login","platform":"mobile","os":"ios","version":"ios-11"}
{"timetamp":1629857927,"user_id":"u0001","transaction_id":"t001","event_type":"payment","platform":"mobile","os":"ios","version":"ios-11"}

## Part 1) Data Model Design
- For analytics purpose (DW/OLTP)
- Start model
    - Fact table as center
    - Dimension tables as attr
- Design
    - Fact table 
        - should only contain "fact", meaning if null we keep `null`, and should be a sparse table by natural
    - Dimension table
        - what, when, who, where, how. 
        - We keep as much informartion as possible there, will do "denormalization" if needed, since hard disk is cheap, computing power is fast. However, nested joins are expensive.
        - each dimension table will use FK (foreign key) connect to fact table

- Table Design
